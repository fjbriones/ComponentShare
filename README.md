# ComponentShare
This is the repository for CoE 134 project, Component Share. Component Share is a sharing and selling platform of electrical components aimed to help EEE students find components they need without the burden of going to stores to look for that component. It also aims to help recycle components from senior students and give them moneterial incentives in return. Our main goal is to connect students in need and students who have components for them to help each other.

To run this app, clone the repository and run
```
node apps.js
